# Tic Tac Toe -v- Computer (by Luke Hickson)

Tic-tac-toe (American English), noughts and crosses (Commonwealth English), or Xs and Os (Irish English) is a paper-and-pencil game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. It is a solved game, with a forced draw assuming best play from both players.

# Rules of the Game (Historically)
<br>

Tic-tac-toe is played on a three-by-three grid by two players, who alternately place the marks X and O in one of the nine spaces in the grid.
There is no universally-agreed rule as to who plays first.
The Aim of the game is the get three of your marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row.
Players soon discover that the best play from both parties leads to a draw. Hence, tic-tac-toe is often played by young children who may not have discovered the optimal strategy.

# User Goals
<br>

## I want to create a game that is easy to navigate for users.

Was this achieved?
Yes
How was this achieved?
This was achieved by taking a very simple apporach to the classic Tic Tac Toe.
The game will run in a smooth loop to allow the user to keep playing as many times as they want to or can end the game.


## I want the user to play against a computer rather than a 2 player game.

Was this achieved?
Yes
How was this achieved?
This was achieved by creating a computer choice function which randomly generates a choice on the board for the computer.  


## I want to make it clear by using a color scheme (Win=Green , Lose=Red) the outcome of the game
